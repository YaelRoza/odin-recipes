              al dente, 8 to 10 minutes</li>
        <li> Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
             Reduce the heat to low and add the spinach and meatballs. 
             Simmer for a few minutes, until the spinach is wilted 
             and the meatballs are warmed through. Ladle into bowls
              and serve with grated Parmigiano Reggiano. </li>
